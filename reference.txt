The phenomenon of climate change is an undeniable reality today. Human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, has triggered a significant increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This increase has caused an increase in the Earth's average temperature, which in turn has triggered a series of devastating impacts on natural systems and human life.

The effects of climate change are evident around the world. From melting glaciers to ocean acidification, signs of climate change are present in every corner of the planet. If we do not take immediate and effective action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changes already underway, the consequences for our planet and future generations will be catastrophic.
